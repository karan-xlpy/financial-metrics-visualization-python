# financial-metrics-visualization-python

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on advanced financial metrics analysis and visualization of leading publicly traded companies, such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Google LLC, Amazon.com Inc., and more.

Utilizing Python, a range of financial ratios has been calculated and visualized to reveal insights into each company's financial health and market standing.

Through a combination of line charts, bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots, the analysis explores trends, compares metrics, and investigates relationships between key financial variables.
